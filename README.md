# Kingdom Builder randomizer
A tool for randomizing the initial setups of the wonderful board game "Kingdom Builder".

## Prerequisites
Microsoft Excel with permissions to run macros. Due to heavy reliance on VBA, this will most likely not work in any other Excel-like program, but it's an untested hypothesis.

## How to use
All the instructions necessary to use the tool effectively are given inside. There are two versions of the file - the "-language" one merely adds the functionality necessary to develop new language versions.

## Contributions

Any comments or bug reports are welcome. The project is complete, however, and I foresee no further development of it in this form. Instead, please see another of my repositories for a React-based website project that will accomplish this very goal, aimed at Kingdom Builder as well as many more games.
